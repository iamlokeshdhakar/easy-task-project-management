## Lessons Learned

I could spend all day describing the lessons that I learned while working on this project, but the most important ones involved my newfound understanding of Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. As my first large project using Node.js backend web technology. I learned a lot of lessons regarding code structure, web page routings, and database manipulation.
